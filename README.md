## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- My favorite applications and their features 
  1. Instagram - notes, story, reels
  2. Goodnotes - Notetaking Components, Easily convertible to PDF, Accessible anywhere and even offline
  3. Discord - Voice and Text channels, Discord Bots, Voice and Video Calling
  4. Google Maps - Updated Location Info, Map UI, Accurate Routes

- App Idea:
  A blog post / journal entry app. It will be a versatile mobile app designed for both bloggers and
  journal enthusiasts, allowing a combination of public expressions and private reflections. There will be
  componenets for both blogging and journal entry with seemless integration, so users switch between them as
  they prefer. Users can also part of communities within the app, should they choose to, while still being an
  independent account. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
